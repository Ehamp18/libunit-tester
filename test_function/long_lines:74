In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (published in 1979), the characters visit the legendary planet Magrathea, home to the now-collapsed planet-building industry, and meet Slartibartfast, a planetary coastline designer who was
responsible for the fjords of Norway. Through archival recordings, he relates the story of a race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings who built a computer named Deep Thought to calculate the Answer to the Ultimate Question
of Life, the Universe, and Everything. When the answer was revealed to be 42, Deep Thought explained that the answer was incomprehensible because the beings didn't know what they were asking. It went on to predict that another
computer, more powerful than itself, would be made and designed by it to calculate the question for the answer. (Later on,referencing this, Adams would create the 42 Puzzle, a puzzle which could be approached in multiple ways,
all yielding the answer 42.) The computer, often mistaken for a planet (because of its size and use of biological components), was the Earth, and was destroyed by Vogons to make way for a hyperspatial express route five minutes
before the conclusion of its 10-million-year program. Two members of the race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings who commissioned the Earth in the first place disguise themselves as Trillian's mice, and want to dissect
Arthur's brain to help reconstruct the question, since he was part of the Earth's matrix moments before it was destroyed, and so he is likely to have part of the question buried in his brain. Trillian is also human but had left
Earth six monthspreviously with Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy. The protagonists escape, setting the course for "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe". The mice, in Arthur's absence, create a phony question since

it is too troublesome for them to wait 10 million years again just to cash in on a lucrative deal. The book was adapted from the first four radio episodes. It was first published in 1979, initially in paperback, by Pan Books,
after BBC Publishing had turned down the offer of publishing a novelization, an action they would later regret.[21] The book reached number one on the book charts in only its second week, and sold over 250,000 copies within three
months of its release. A hardback edition was published by Harmony Books, a division of Random House in the United States in October1980, and the 1981 US paperback edition was promoted by the give-away of 3,000 free copies in the
magazine Rolling Stone to build word of mouth. In 2005, Del Rey Books re-released the Hitchhiker series with new covers for the release of the 2005 movie. To date, it has sold over 14 million copies.[22]

In The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (published in 1980), Zaphod is separated from the others and finds he is part of a conspiracy to uncover who really runs the Universe. Zaphod meets Zarniwoop, a conspirator and editor
for The Guide, who knows where to find the secret ruler. Zaphod becomes briefly reunited with the others for a trip to Milliways, the restaurant of the title. Zaphod and Ford decide to steal a ship from there, which turns out to
be a stunt ship pre-programmed to plunge into a star as a special effect in a stage show. Unable to change course, the main characters get Marvin to run the teleporter they find in the ship, which is working other than having no
automatic control (someone must remain behind to operate it), and Marvin seemingly sacrifices himself. Zaphod andTrillian discover that the Universe is in the safe hands of a simple man living on a remote planet in a wooden shack
with his cat.Ford and Arthur, meanwhile, end up on a spacecraft full of the outcasts of the Golgafrinchan civilization. The ship crashes on prehistoric Earth; Ford and Arthur are stranded, and it becomes clear that the inept
Golgafrinchans are the ancestors of modern humans, having displaced the Earth's indigenous hominids. This has disrupted the Earth's programming so that when Ford and Arthur manage to extract the final readout from Arthur's subconscious
mind by pulling lettered tiles from a Scrabble set, it is "What do you get if you multiply six by nine?" Arthur then comments, "I've always said there was something fundamentally wrong with the universe."The book was adaptedfrom the

remaining material in the radio series—covering from the fifth episode to the twelfth episode, although the ordering was greatly changed (in particular, the events of Fit the Sixth, with Ford and Arthur being stranded on pre-historic
Earth, end the book, and their rescue in Fit the Seventh is deleted), and most of the Brontitall incident was omitted, instead of the Haggunenon sequence, co-written by John Loyd, the Disaster Area stunt ship was substituted—this having
first been introduced in the LP version. Adams himself considered Restaurant to be his best novel of the five.[23]

"It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the
