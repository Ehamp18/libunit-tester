Hang on... Three of you, in one cell, and none of you thought to try the door
Just because my pretty face has turned your head do not assume I am so easily distracted.
One day you meet the Doctor. And of course, it’s the best day ever.
It’s just the best day of your life. Because...because, he’s brilliant,
and he’s funny, and mad, and best of all...really needs you. The trick is –
don’t fall in love. I do that trick quite a lot, sometimes twice a day. And
once you start running, you start to forget; slowly, after a while, you just
stopping asking. Who are you? Where are you from? What set you on your way
and where are you going? Oh...and what is your name? You get used to not
knowing. I thought I never would. I was wrong. I know who he is. I know how he
began and I know where he’s going. I learnt the truth about the Doctor and his
greatest secret the day we went to Trenzalore.

crashed and shipwrecked somewhere... not nice. Been here a year, rest of the
crew missing. Provisions good, but keen to move on.
